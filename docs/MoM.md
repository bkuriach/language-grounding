## Meeting Dated: 23-06-2022

1. Email the authors about the affordance Knowledge Base
2. - XGLUE is a data constructed from different premises (XNLI, MLNI)... Search in ImageNet, VisualGenome for corresponding images of the samples of XGLUE data. (Given premise as caption, find image)
   - If image available use visual attributes, otherwise use other attributes and utilize KB + MLN to predict top 10 affordances
3. For Human as object, don't consider what human beings can do in general. E.g.  Old man is walking -> Try to predict affordance of 'old man'
4. Skim through the dataset and need to plan to find what are the valid high quality affordances.
5. Map the corresponding candidate objects in English texts to their other versions (Hindi, Spanish etc).. to be used to find multilingual representation of objects
6. To Study:
  - Analysis of Universal Language Models
  - Muril, XLM-R, mBERT  
  - GATO agent
  - The State and Fate of Linguistic Diversity and Inclusion in the NLP World (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.09095.pdf)
